\f0\fs24 \cf0 I went with a font that I thought looked clean and simple.  I was trying to make it work with the message in the photo as well as the purpose of the site-Calm, Strong, Clean.  I think it may work better with a different font for the title of the site (Serif) and this font in the body.\

On the second screen shot, I went with with a Serif font.  I do not like this for the header of the body text.  It doesn\'92t look bad in h2 (CALM | STRONG | CLEAN).  }
